# Predicting COVID-19 pneumonia severity from Chest X-Ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks
Here is our implementation of approach built for the paper named: Predicting COVID-19 pneumonia severity from Chest X-Ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks
# Introduction
COVID-19 is a disease with the potential to cause lung damage, often manifesting in various degrees of severity. Predicting and classifying the extent of lung damage in COVID-19 from chest X-ray images is a crucial part of the diagnostic and treatment process. Alongside advancements in machine learning and deep neural networks, the application of cutting-edge technologies to support the medical field plays a significant role in improving the speed and accuracy of lung damage classification. Deep Neural Network (DNN) methods have emerged as one of the potential approaches, harnessing the capability of deep data analysis, particularly in image data, through a series of deep neural layers in the network. Our research has objectively evaluated the performance of modern Deep Neural Network methods in classifying the extent of lung damage in COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. To ensure accuracy and objectivity in the process of classifying COVID-19 lung damage, we have proposed a high-performance model, along with the suggestion of a new, diverse dataset to cater to the needs. This model yields favorable results in the defined metrics and exhibits excellent adaptability to the proposed datasets, marking a significant improvement in COVID-19 lung damage classification.
